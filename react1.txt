How ReactJs works internally
============================
Diagram: react1.1

React uses a virtual DOM that is basically a DOM tree representation in JavaScript. 

So when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use the virtual representation of it.Then the virtual DOM will try to find the most efficient way to update the browser's DOM.

Assume we have created multiple components and consistently we are performing some changes in our application.Now we need to see ,how virtual DOM react on each change.
